# Battle Board

This repo was created due to the fact our "Organization" repo requires reviews before committing. Thus to do testing on Heroku it was easier to deploy off of my own repo.

## Dependencies:
- Express
- Express Session (express-session)
- Body Parser (body-parser)
- Method Override (method-override)
- Passport
- Passport Local (passport-local)
- Sequelize
- Mongoose
- MySQL2 
```
npm install express express-session body-parser method-override passport passport-local sequelize  mongoose mysql2 --save
```
